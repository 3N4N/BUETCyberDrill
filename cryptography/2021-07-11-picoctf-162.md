## Description

In RSA, a small e value can be problematic, but what about N? Can you decrypt
this? [values][1]


## Explanation

The [values][1] file contains the values of N, E, and C. Check a tutorial on RSA
to know what N, E, and C means.

In order to determine the flag, we need to find P and Q, which are the prime
factors of N. We can use [this database][2] to find P and Q easily. After that
we'll use the following python script to determine the flag. The script was
taken from [this website][3].

```python
# https://asecuritysite.com/encryption/rsa12_2
from Crypto.Util.number import long_to_bytes
import libnum

c = 421345306292040663864066688931456845278496274597031632020995583473619804626233684
e = 65537

p = 1461849912200000206276283741896701133693
q = 431899300006243611356963607089521499045809

n = p*q
phi=(p-1)*(q-1)

e=65537
d=(libnum.invmod(e, phi))

res=pow(c,d, n)

print ("Cipher: ",c)
print ("p: ",p)
print ("q: ",q)

print ("\n=== Calc ===")
print ("d=",d)
print ("n=",n)
print ("Decrypt: %s" % ((long_to_bytes(res))))
