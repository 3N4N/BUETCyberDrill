## Description

We found a brand new type of encryption, can you break the secret code? (Wrap
with picoCTF{})

[new_caesar.py][1]

## Explanation

`new_caesar.py` contains a python code for encoding a string. All we need to do
is build a decoder which will calculate the plaintext from the cipher. I wrote
the following python script to do just that.

*Note* that the `key` in the code is hardcoded as *k*, but it could be anything
between *a* to *p* (since it was asserted that the length of key is 1 and that
the letter it contains is also contained by the array `ALPHABET`). I should've
wrote a for loop, but it's a quick-and-dirty method for learning purpose. We can
care about better coding practices some other time.

```python
import string

LOWERCASE_OFFSET = ord("a")
ALPHABET = string.ascii_lowercase[:16]

def b16_encode(plain):
    enc = ""
    for c in plain:
        binary = "{0:08b}".format(ord(c))
        enc += ALPHABET[int(binary[:4], 2)]
        enc += ALPHABET[int(binary[4:], 2)]
    return enc

def b16_decode(plain):
    dec = ""
    for i in range(0,len(plain),2):
        c1 = plain[i]
        c2 = plain[i+1]
        bin1 = ord(c1) - ord('a')
        bin2 = ord(c2) - ord('a')
        binary = "{0:04b}".format(bin1) + "{0:04b}".format(bin2)
        dec += chr(int(binary,2))
    return dec

def shift(c, k):
    t1 = ord(c) - LOWERCASE_OFFSET
    t2 = ord(k) - LOWERCASE_OFFSET
    return ALPHABET[(t1 + t2) % len(ALPHABET)]

def rshift(c, k):
    t1 = ord(c) - LOWERCASE_OFFSET
    t2 = ord(k) - LOWERCASE_OFFSET
    if t1 < t2:
        return ALPHABET[(t1 - t2) + len(ALPHABET)]
    else:
        return ALPHABET[(t1 - t2) % len(ALPHABET)]


string = "a"
string="apbopjbobpnjpjnmnnnmnlnbamnpnononpnaaaamnlnkapndnkncamnpapncnbannaapncndnlnpna"
key = "k"       # Try all the letters from ALPHABET[0:16]
assert all([k in ALPHABET for k in key])
assert len(key) == 1

new = ""
for i, c in enumerate(string):
  new += rshift(c, key[i % len(key)])

b16 = b16_decode(new)
print(b16)
