## Description

I wonder what this really is... [enc][1]

```python
''.join([chr((ord(flag[i]) << 8) + ord(flag[i + 1])) for i in range(0, len(flag), 2)])
```


## Explanation

The enc file contains a string of encrypted data. The python oneliner given in
the description is how the original string was encrypted into the given string.
So we need to reverse-transform the encrypted string back to the original
string. For that I wrote the following python script.

```python
string = '灩捯䍔䙻ㄶ形楴獟楮獴㌴摟潦弸彥㜰㍢㐸㙽' # content of the file 'enc'
flag = ''   # stores our flag

for i in range(0, len(string)):
    flag += chr((ord(string[i]) >> 8) & 0xff)
    flag += chr(ord(string[i]) & 0xff)

print(flag)
```

If you notice the python oneliner given in the challenge description, you'll see
that all they did to encrypt the flag was to take two 8-bit characters from the
flag, left shift the preceding character 8 bits, and concatenate the numeric
values of them. The numeric value was then casted in ASCII format to get the
encrypted string.

The decryption script takes each character of the encrypted string, converts it
to numeric, and divides the 16-bit character into two 8-bit characters. After
looping this way over the whole encrypted string, we get two flag characters for
each encrypted character, which is stored in the flag variable. Printing that
variable gives the flag.
